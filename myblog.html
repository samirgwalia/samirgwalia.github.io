      <p>I remember when I was a kid, Chetan Bhagat was one of those writers whom I knew. My papa and mummy both are book lovers they mostly read Hindi novels because we are from a village in Bihar so they never got the opportunity to learn English. They had not enough money to send me to the best school but they did the best for me they gave their 1000%. And will not be able to thank them enough. In a village where most of the people are not able to speak Hindi properly, I was raised as a boy who was decent in English this was enough to boost my confidence to learn more. My papa always used to see the newspaper to know if there are any Book Fair going to be organised at Patna. He used to save money to buy books for me. He introduced me to books our stomach was empty but we had a bag of books. I used to get attracted towards the fancy books for kids and their price but their price was beyond our capacity. And the hero enters CHETAN BHAGAT and RUSKIN BOND not just with simple English but also with affordable price. My father introduced me to "5 point someone", he said that 3 idiot movie was based on this and this was enough to create a spark in me. 
I used to flex that book in school as I read novels, I remember the most famous girl in my class asked me that book. Till then I was no one in my class and because of that book, I made friends. I gained confidence.</p>
